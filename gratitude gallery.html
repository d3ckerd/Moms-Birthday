        <li> You provide constant support, no matter how annoying I can be! </li>
        <li> You have fostered a sense of love and acceptance in our family </li>
        <li> You have a strong sense of humor (not for poop jokes though) </li>
        <li> You have always been there when I need someone to talk to, which I deeply appreciate </li>
        <li> You always keep our house tidy, even though all of us are so messy</li>
        <li> You have an amazing taste in music, even if it is a bit old fashioned </li>
        <li> Perhaps one of the most important, you have always had such a kind soul ðŸ˜Š </li>
